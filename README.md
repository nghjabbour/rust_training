# Advanced Rust Learning Path

This comprehensive tutorial is designed to take you from an experienced programmer to a Rust expert. Each module includes in-depth explanations of not just how to use Rust features, but why they exist and how they work under the hood.

## How to Use This Tutorial

### Getting Started
1. Make sure you have Rust installed. If not, visit [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) to install it.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Start with Module 1 and work your way through the modules sequentially.
4. Each module has its own README.md with specific instructions.

### For Each Module
1. Read the module's README.md for an overview and learning objectives.
2. Study the explanations and examples in `src/main.rs`.
3. Run the code using `cargo run` within the module directory.
4. Complete the exercises in `src/problems.rs`.
5. Verify your understanding before moving to the next module.
