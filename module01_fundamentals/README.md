# Module 1: Rust Fundamentals

## Overview
This module introduces the fundamental concepts of Rust programming language. It covers the basic syntax, type system, memory layout, expressions, control flow, and closures. This is the foundation upon which all other Rust knowledge is built.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Rust's type system and memory layout
- Learn about Rust's expression-based nature
- Explore memory management through ownership and borrowing
- Practice control flow and pattern matching
- Implement and use functions and closures

## How to Use This Module
1. Start by reading through the explanations and examples in `src/main.rs`
2. Run the code to see the concepts in action:
   ```
   cd module1
   cargo run
   ```
3. Study the exercises in `src/problems.rs`
4. Try to understand each exercise before looking at the solutions
5. Experiment by modifying the code to deepen your understanding

## Exercises
This module contains five exercises:
1. **Type System and Memory Layout**: Explore how Rust's type system ensures memory safety
2. **Expression Evaluation**: Learn about Rust's expression-based nature
3. **Memory Management**: Understand stack vs heap allocation and borrowing rules
4. **Control Flow and Pattern Matching**: Practice using match expressions and patterns
5. **Functions and Closures**: Implement higher-order functions and closures

## Prerequisites
- Basic programming knowledge
- Rust installed on your system (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Cargo (comes with Rust installation)

## Next Steps
After completing this module, proceed to Module 2 to learn about ownership and borrowing in more depth.
