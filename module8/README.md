# Module 8: Smart Pointers and Interior Mutability

## Overview
This module explores Rust's smart pointers and interior mutability patterns. Smart pointers are data structures that act like pointers but provide additional functionality, such as reference counting and automatic cleanup. Interior mutability allows you to mutate data even when there are immutable references to that data, using Rust's type system to ensure this happens safely.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the role of smart pointers in Rust
- Master the Box<T> type for heap allocation
- Learn about reference counting with Rc<T> and Arc<T>
- Explore interior mutability with Cell<T> and RefCell<T>
- Understand the Deref and Drop traits
- Implement custom smart pointers
- Learn when and how to use weak references

## How to Use This Module
1. Start by reading through the explanations and examples in `src/main.rs`
2. Run the code to see the concepts in action:
   ```
   cd module8
   cargo run
   ```
3. Study the exercises in `src/problems.rs`
4. Try to understand each exercise before looking at the solutions
5. Experiment by modifying the code to deepen your understanding

## Exercises
This module contains exercises that focus on:
1. **Box<T>**: Using heap allocation for recursive data structures
2. **Rc<T> and Arc<T>**: Implementing shared ownership
3. **RefCell<T> and Cell<T>**: Working with interior mutability
4. **Custom Smart Pointers**: Implementing the Deref and Drop traits
5. **Weak References**: Breaking reference cycles with Weak<T>

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Modules 1-7
- Solid understanding of Rust's ownership system
- Familiarity with traits and generics

## Next Steps
After completing this module, proceed to Module 9 to learn about advanced pattern matching techniques in Rust.
