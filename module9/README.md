# Module 9: Advanced Pattern Matching

## Overview
This module explores Rust's powerful pattern matching capabilities in depth. Pattern matching in Rust goes far beyond simple switch statements found in other languages, allowing for complex destructuring, binding, and conditional matching. You'll learn how to use advanced pattern matching techniques to write concise, expressive, and safe code.

## Learning Objectives
- Master all pattern matching syntax and capabilities in Rust
- Learn destructuring patterns for structs, enums, and tuples
- Understand pattern binding and variable capture
- Use match guards and conditional patterns
- Implement complex pattern matching in let statements, function parameters, and more
- Learn about refutability and irrefutability in patterns

## How to Use This Module
1. Start by reading through the explanations and examples in `src/main.rs`
2. Run the code to see the concepts in action:
   ```
   cd module9
   cargo run
   ```
3. Study the exercises in `src/problems.rs`
4. Try to understand each exercise before looking at the solutions
5. Experiment by modifying the code to deepen your understanding

## Exercises
This module contains exercises that focus on:
1. **Destructuring**: Breaking down complex data structures
2. **Pattern Binding**: Capturing values in variables during matching
3. **Match Guards**: Adding conditional logic to pattern matches
4. **Range Patterns**: Matching on ranges of values
5. **Advanced Techniques**: Combining multiple pattern matching features

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Modules 1-8
- Solid understanding of Rust's type system
- Familiarity with basic pattern matching from earlier modules

## Next Steps
After completing this module, proceed to Module 10 to learn about advanced features and unsafe Rust.
