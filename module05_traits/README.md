# Module 5: Traits and Generics

## Overview
This module explores Rust's trait system and generics in depth. Traits are Rust's approach to shared behavior across types, similar to interfaces in other languages but with more capabilities. Combined with generics, traits enable you to write flexible, reusable code without sacrificing performance or type safety.

## Learning Objectives
- Master Rust's trait system for defining shared behavior
- Understand trait bounds and where clauses
- Implement trait objects for dynamic dispatch
- Use associated types and default implementations
- Create generic code that works with multiple types
- Learn about marker traits and their significance

## How to Use This Module
1. Start by reading through the explanations and examples in `src/main.rs`
2. Run the code to see the concepts in action:
   ```
   cd module5
   cargo run
   ```
3. Study the exercises in `src/problems.rs`
4. Try to understand each exercise before looking at the solutions
5. Experiment by modifying the code to deepen your understanding

## Exercises
This module contains exercises that focus on:
1. **Trait Implementation**: Creating and implementing traits for different types
2. **Generic Functions**: Writing functions that work with multiple types
3. **Trait Bounds**: Constraining generic types with trait requirements
4. **Trait Objects**: Using dynamic dispatch for runtime polymorphism
5. **Advanced Trait Features**: Working with associated types and default implementations

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Modules 1-4
- Solid understanding of Rust's type system

## Next Steps
After completing this module, proceed to Module 6 to learn about testing and documentation in Rust.
