# Module 3: Type System and Pattern Matching

## Overview
This module explores Rust's rich type system and pattern matching capabilities. You'll learn about structs, enums, traits, and how to use pattern matching to write expressive and safe code. These features enable you to create powerful abstractions while maintaining Rust's safety guarantees.

## Learning Objectives
- Master Rust's struct and enum types for modeling data
- Understand traits and how they enable polymorphism in Rust
- Learn advanced pattern matching techniques
- Implement methods and associated functions
- Use generics to write flexible, reusable code

## How to Use This Module
1. Start by reading through the explanations and examples in `src/main.rs`
2. Run the code to see the concepts in action:
   ```
   cd module3
   cargo run
   ```
3. Study the exercises in `src/problems.rs`
4. Try to understand each exercise before looking at the solutions
5. Experiment by modifying the code to deepen your understanding

## Exercises
This module contains exercises that focus on:
1. **Structs and Methods**: Creating custom data types with associated behavior
2. **Enums and Pattern Matching**: Using enums to represent variants and matching on them
3. **Traits**: Implementing shared behavior across different types
4. **Generics**: Writing code that works with multiple types
5. **Advanced Pattern Matching**: Using complex patterns to destructure data

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Module 1: Rust Fundamentals
- Completion of Module 2: Ownership and Borrowing
- Understanding of basic Rust syntax and concepts

## Next Steps
After completing this module, proceed to Module 4 to learn about collections and error handling in Rust.
