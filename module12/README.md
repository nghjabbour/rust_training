# Module 12: Production Rust

## Overview
This module focuses on writing production-ready Rust code. You'll learn best practices for performance optimization, error handling, logging, configuration management, and deployment. This module bridges the gap between learning Rust and using it effectively in real-world applications and production environments.

## Learning Objectives
- Implement robust error handling strategies for production applications
- Master performance optimization techniques specific to Rust
- Learn proper logging and monitoring approaches
- Understand configuration management in Rust applications
- Explore deployment strategies for Rust binaries
- Implement proper testing strategies for production code
- Learn about profiling and benchmarking Rust applications

## How to Use This Module
1. Start by reading through the explanations and examples in `src/main.rs`
2. Run the code to see the concepts in action:
   ```
   cd module12
   cargo run
   ```
3. Study the exercises in `src/problems.rs`
4. Try to understand each exercise before looking at the solutions
5. Experiment by modifying the code to deepen your understanding

## Exercises
This module contains exercises that focus on:
1. **Error Handling**: Creating custom error types and handling errors robustly
2. **Performance Optimization**: Profiling and optimizing Rust code
3. **Configuration Management**: Managing application configuration
4. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implementing proper logging
5. **Deployment**: Preparing Rust applications for production deployment

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Modules 1-11
- Experience with all core Rust concepts
- Basic understanding of software development lifecycle

## Next Steps
Congratulations on completing the entire Rust tutorial! You now have a comprehensive understanding of Rust and are ready to build production-quality applications. Consider contributing to open-source Rust projects or starting your own project to further develop your skills.
