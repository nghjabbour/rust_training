# Module 6: Testing and Documentation

## Overview
This module covers Rust's built-in testing framework and documentation system. You'll learn how to write unit tests, integration tests, and documentation tests to ensure your code works correctly and is well-documented. Rust's testing and documentation tools are first-class features of the language, making it easy to maintain high-quality code.

## Learning Objectives
- Write effective unit tests using Rust's testing framework
- Create integration tests for testing modules as a whole
- Generate and write documentation with Markdown and doc comments
- Implement documentation tests that verify code examples
- Use test organization techniques like test modules and helper functions
- Understand test-driven development in Rust

## How to Use This Module
1. Start by reading through the explanations and examples in `src/main.rs`
2. Run the code and tests:
   ```
   cd module6
   cargo run    # Run the main program
   cargo test   # Run all tests
   cargo doc --open  # Generate and view documentation
   ```
3. Study the exercises in `src/problems.rs`
4. Try to understand each exercise before looking at the solutions
5. Experiment by writing your own tests and documentation

## Exercises
This module contains exercises that focus on:
1. **Unit Testing**: Writing tests for individual functions and methods
2. **Test Organization**: Structuring tests for maintainability
3. **Integration Testing**: Testing the interaction between modules
4. **Documentation Comments**: Writing clear and helpful documentation
5. **Doc Tests**: Creating examples that serve as both documentation and tests

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Modules 1-5
- Understanding of Rust's basic syntax and concepts

## Next Steps
After completing this module, proceed to Module 7 to learn about concurrency and parallelism in Rust.
