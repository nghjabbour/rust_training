# Module 2: Ownership and Borrowing

## Overview
This module explores Rust's ownership system, which is the cornerstone of Rust's memory safety guarantees without requiring garbage collection. You'll learn about ownership rules, borrowing, references, and lifetimes - concepts that make Rust unique among programming languages.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Rust's ownership rules and how they prevent memory safety issues
- Learn about borrowing and references in Rust
- Explore mutable and immutable references and their constraints
- Understand lifetimes and how they ensure memory safety
- Practice implementing data structures with proper ownership semantics

## How to Use This Module
1. Start by reading through the explanations and examples in `src/main.rs`
2. Run the code to see the concepts in action:
   ```
   cd module2
   cargo run
   ```
3. Study the exercises in `src/problems.rs`
4. Try to understand each exercise before looking at the solutions
5. Experiment by modifying the code to deepen your understanding

## Exercises
This module contains exercises that focus on:
1. **Ownership Transfer**: Understanding how values move between variables
2. **Borrowing Rules**: Working with references and their constraints
3. **Lifetimes**: Exploring how Rust tracks references' validity
4. **Data Structures**: Implementing structures with proper ownership semantics
5. **Slices**: Working with partial views of collections

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Module 1: Rust Fundamentals
- Understanding of basic Rust syntax and concepts

## Next Steps
After completing this module, proceed to Module 3 to learn about Rust's type system and pattern matching.
