# Module 7: Concurrency and Parallelism

## Overview
This module explores Rust's approach to concurrent and parallel programming. Rust's ownership and type systems provide strong guarantees about thread safety, eliminating entire classes of concurrency bugs at compile time. You'll learn about threads, message passing, shared state, async/await, and how Rust's ownership model ensures safe concurrent code.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the difference between concurrency and parallelism
- Create and manage threads using Rust's standard library
- Implement message passing concurrency with channels
- Share state safely between threads using mutex and atomic types
- Learn about Rust's async/await syntax for asynchronous programming
- Explore the Send and Sync traits that enable safe concurrent code

## How to Use This Module
1. Start by reading through the explanations and examples in `src/main.rs`
2. Run the code to see the concepts in action:
   ```
   cd module7
   cargo run
   ```
3. Study the exercises in `src/problems.rs`
4. Try to understand each exercise before looking at the solutions
5. Experiment by modifying the code to deepen your understanding

## Exercises
This module contains exercises that focus on:
1. **Thread Basics**: Creating and joining threads
2. **Message Passing**: Using channels to communicate between threads
3. **Shared State**: Safely sharing data between threads
4. **Async Programming**: Working with futures and async/await
5. **Thread Pools**: Managing a pool of worker threads for efficient execution

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Modules 1-6
- Solid understanding of Rust's ownership and borrowing system
- Basic knowledge of concurrent programming concepts

## Next Steps
After completing this module, proceed to Module 8 to learn about smart pointers and interior mutability in Rust.
