# Module 4: Collections and Error Handling

## Overview
This module covers Rust's collection types and error handling mechanisms. You'll learn how to work with vectors, strings, hash maps, and other collections efficiently. Additionally, you'll explore Rust's robust error handling through the Result and Option types, which help eliminate entire classes of runtime errors.

## Learning Objectives
- Master Rust's standard collection types (Vec, String, HashMap)
- Understand the performance characteristics of different collections
- Learn idiomatic error handling with Result and Option types
- Implement the ? operator for concise error propagation
- Create custom error types for your applications

## How to Use This Module
1. Start by reading through the explanations and examples in `src/main.rs`
2. Run the code to see the concepts in action:
   ```
   cd module4
   cargo run
   ```
3. Study the exercises in `src/problems.rs`
4. Try to understand each exercise before looking at the solutions
5. Experiment by modifying the code to deepen your understanding

## Exercises
This module contains exercises that focus on:
1. **Vectors and Slices**: Working with dynamic arrays and views into arrays
2. **Strings and String Manipulation**: Understanding UTF-8 and string operations
3. **Hash Maps**: Using key-value collections for efficient lookups
4. **Option Type**: Handling the absence of values without null references
5. **Result Type**: Handling operations that can fail with detailed error information

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Modules 1-3
- Understanding of Rust's ownership system and type system

## Next Steps
After completing this module, proceed to Module 5 to learn about traits and generics in more depth.
