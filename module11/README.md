# Module 11: Rust Tooling and Ecosystem

## Overview
This module explores the rich tooling and ecosystem that surrounds the Rust programming language. You'll learn about Cargo (Rust's package manager and build system), useful development tools, popular crates, and how to integrate Rust with other languages and systems. Understanding these tools and resources is essential for productive Rust development.

## Learning Objectives
- Master Cargo for dependency management and project organization
- Learn about Rust's development tools (rustfmt, clippy, rustdoc)
- Understand workspace management for multi-crate projects
- Explore popular crates in the Rust ecosystem
- Learn how to publish your own crates
- Understand cross-compilation and targeting different platforms
- Use build scripts and conditional compilation

## How to Use This Module
1. Start by reading through the explanations and examples in `src/main.rs`
2. Run the code and try the tools:
   ```
   cd module11
   cargo run
   cargo fmt
   cargo clippy
   cargo doc --open
   ```
3. Study the exercises in `src/problems.rs`
4. Try to understand each exercise before looking at the solutions
5. Experiment by modifying the code to deepen your understanding

## Exercises
This module contains exercises that focus on:
1. **Cargo Features**: Using workspaces, profiles, and features
2. **Development Tools**: Integrating rustfmt, clippy, and other tools
3. **Crate Exploration**: Finding and using third-party crates
4. **Build Scripts**: Customizing the build process
5. **Publishing**: Preparing a crate for publication

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Modules 1-10
- Familiarity with command-line tools
- Understanding of package management concepts

## Next Steps
After completing this module, proceed to Module 12 to learn about production Rust and best practices for real-world applications.
